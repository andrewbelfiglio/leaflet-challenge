# leaflet-challenge

### This project is an assignment in the Data Science and Data Visualizations bootcamp at the University of Pennsylvania in collaboration with edX.

### This repository contains an index.html file in the Leaflet-Part-1 folder, to display the visualization in a browser. 

### The logic.js file (found at Leaflet-Part-1/static/js/logic.js) calls in earthquake data from the USGS, for earthquakes that have occured in that past day. The visualization maps earthquakes as circles, with the size of the circle corresponding to the quake magnitude and the opacity of the circle corresponding to the quake depth. 

### This code is original and is based on the curriculum of the bootcamp program.
